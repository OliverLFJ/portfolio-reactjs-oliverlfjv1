        "history": "When I was 13 years old my parents bought me my first computer, I remember that one day while watching videos on Youtube a video caught my attention; create your own application with HTML and CSS, I remember that I did not understand anything about what the video said, I remember that I only watched a few minutes and decided to close the video for demotivation. It wasn't until high school where I learned a little bit of programming and started to get into the world of coding. Undoubtedly front end programming managed to capture my attention and I focused my efforts on understanding technologies, currently React JS is one of the front end technologies that I am using more and to which I have dedicated more time.",

ReactJS is currently my main framework, I simply love the way I can develop systems, I have tried to enter companies that ask for ReactJS, but for the same reason that I have never been in a company that has a React project, they do not give me that opportunity that I have been looking for so much, I hope that my portfolio and my personal projects are of some use and I manage to enter a company that trusts me."
